                    <p><strong>6.1.</strong> The Information Services provided by the Contractor via the Platform are offered to the Customer free of charge.</p>
                    <p><strong>6.2.</strong> The gratuitous nature of the Information Services does not release the Customer from complying with the terms of this Offer and the requirements of the law.</p>
                    <p><strong>6.3.</strong> The Platform may display offers for ancillary services from third-party providers, including but not limited to visa services, translation services, transportation assistance, accommodation booking, and other services. Such services are not Information Services of the Contractor, are provided on a paid basis by the respective providers, and are governed by separate agreements between the Customer and such provider. The Contractor is not a party to such agreements, does not control the cost, timing, scope, or quality of ancillary services, and is not liable for their performance.</p>
                    <p><strong>6.4.</strong> The Contractor may, in the future, change the terms of provision of Information Services, including introducing a fee, by posting the relevant information on the Platform at least ten (10) calendar days before such changes take effect.</p>
                    <p><strong>6.5.</strong> If a fee for the Information Services is introduced, the Contractor will indicate on the Platform the amount, payment methods, and payment procedure.</p>
                    <p><strong>6.6.</strong> A Customer who disagrees with the introduction of a fee may stop using the Platform before the effective date of such changes. Continued use of the Platform after this date constitutes the Customer’s acceptance of the new terms.</p>

                    <p><strong>7.2.</strong> The Contractor is not responsible for the quality, timing, scope, or results of medical services provided by a Medical Institution, nor for the accuracy, completeness, relevance, or content of information posted by Medical Institutions on the Platform.
